Team AIM - Alexandra Staykova, Alexander Klingenberg, Miroslav Ivanov, Polina Petrova

This is out team for the Second Sprint Project - Char, String, Array.
The main idea is to make a game, in which there will be an area with "random" letters and the player have to find specific words. The game also can be called 'Find the words', but we decided to call it 'Wordy'.
